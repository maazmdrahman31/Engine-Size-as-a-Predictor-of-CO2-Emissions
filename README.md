"Engine Size as a Predictor of CO2 Emissions: Developing a Data-Driven Model for Environmental Impact Assessment"

1. As we all know Co2Emissions(Carbon dioxide) has now become one of the common gases that impacts on the Global Warming.

2. In this project we will use the fuelconsumption.csv Dataset to analyze and find out reasons that leads to large amount of CO2EMISSIONS.

3. Here we will analyze the below given aspects and features..
    ---> 1. First, We will visualize all the features in the Dataset.
    ---> 2. Using "CYLINDER" as a dependent variable to predict the "CO2EMISSIONS" aka "Target Variable".
    ---> 3. Using "FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB" as a dependent variable to predict the "CO2EMISSIONS".
    ---> 4. Using "ENGINE SIZE" as a dependent variable to predict the "CO2EMISSIONS".

4. Developing a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict the "CO2EMSSIONS" using "ENGINE SIZE" as a predictor.

5. Performing Cross-Validation (KFold) to assess the performance of the model (OPTIONAL IN SLR).

---> Conclusion:-
After analyzing the dataset and building a predictive model using LinearRegression Machine Learning model, we have concluded that,
    1. "ENGINE SIZE" is the variable that impacts CO2EMISSIONS the most.
    2. "CYLINDERS" has no impact on CO2EMISSIONS.
    3. "FUELCONSUMPTION" has some impact on CO2EMISSIONS.
